Of course. To maximize success in your project, it's crucial to harness the power of AI coding assistants not just as code generators, but as intelligent collaborators. This requires a unified strategy that combines a core philosophy of AI usage with tool-specific guidelines and custom instructions.

Here is a comprehensive guide for leveraging JetBrains Junie, JetBrains AI Assistant, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot for your project.

### A Unified Guideline for Maximizing Success with AI Coding Assistants

#### **Part 1: The Core Philosophy — Universal Best Practices**

Before delving into tool-specific configurations, your entire team should adopt a consistent mindset and workflow for interacting with any AI assistant. These universal principles are the foundation for effective and safe AI-assisted development.

**1. AI is a Collaborator, Not a Replacement**
Treat every AI assistant as a junior developer on your team—one that is incredibly fast and knowledgeable but lacks true understanding of the project's overarching goals and business logic.[1] The AI is here to handle repetitive tasks, generate boilerplate, suggest optimizations, and assist with debugging, but the ultimate responsibility for the code's quality, security, and correctness rests with the human developer.[2]

**2. The "Trust but Verify" Imperative: Always Review and Test**
Never blindly accept AI-generated code.[3] Every suggestion, no matter how simple, must be treated as an untrusted draft that requires rigorous validation.[2, 4]

* **Human Review:** The developer who prompted the code is the first line of defense. You must understand what the code does, why it was written that way, and how it fits into the larger architecture.[5] A reviewer of AI-generated code should be even more skeptical than usual, as the original author (the AI) has no true comprehension.[6]
* **Focus on Edge Cases and Logic:** AI models often miss edge cases, produce logically inconsistent results, or fail to implement robust error handling.[4] Pay special attention to these areas during your review.
* **Automated Checks:** Reinforce all AI-generated code with your existing CI/CD pipeline. Automated tests, static analysis, and linting are essential for catching errors, security flaws, and non-standard patterns that a human review might miss.[4]

**3. Master the Art of Prompt Engineering**
The quality of the output is directly proportional to the quality of the input.[1] Vague requests yield generic and often incorrect results. Structure your prompts using four key components:

* **Persona/Role:** Tell the AI who it should be. For example, "Act as an expert Python developer specializing in secure, high-performance backend services".[7]
* **Task/Instruction:** Give a clear, direct, and singular command. Use action verbs like "Write," "Refactor," "Generate," "Explain".[7, 8]
* **Context:** Provide all necessary background information. This includes the programming language, key libraries (PyQt6, Kotlin, CameraX), architectural patterns (Hub-and-Spoke), and the specific code snippet to work on, separated by delimiters like `"""`.[9]
* **Format:** Specify the desired output format, such as a code snippet, a bulleted list, or a table.[9]

For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, sequential prompts. This iterative approach yields far better results than a single, overloaded request.[5, 9]

**4. Uphold a Zero-Tolerance Security and Privacy Policy**
This is non-negotiable. Interacting with cloud-based AI assistants opens new attack vectors and risks for intellectual property exposure.[10]

* **Never Include Secrets in Prompts:** Do not paste API keys, passwords, credentials, or any personally identifiable information into an AI prompt. Assume anything you send is stored and potentially used for model training.[10, 11, 12]
* **Disable Telemetry:** In your IDE and tool settings, disable any telemetry or code-snippet sharing features that send your proprietary code to the vendor for model improvement.[10]
* **Be Wary of Dependencies:** AI assistants often suggest third-party libraries. Always vet these dependencies for security vulnerabilities before incorporating them into the project.[12]
* **Document AI Usage:** For transparency and future debugging, label AI-generated code in comments or commit messages (e.g., `feat: Add user login service (generated by Copilot)`). This helps track the origin of the code and signals to reviewers that it requires extra scrutiny.[2, 6]

#### **Part 2: Tool-Specific Guidelines and Custom Instructions**

While the core philosophy is universal, each tool has unique features that can be customized to align with your project's specific needs.

##### **1. GitHub Copilot**

* **Strengths:** Best-in-class inline code completion and a powerful chat agent that is context-aware of your open files.
* **Custom Instructions:** Copilot's behavior can be guided for your entire repository by creating a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. This ensures consistency across the team.[13, 14, 15]

**Sample `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:**

# GitHub Copilot Instructions for the Multi-Modal Sensing Platform

## About This Project

This project is a multi-modal physiological data acquisition platform. It consists of a central PC Controller (the Hub) written in Python with a PyQt6 GUI, and one or more Android Sensor Nodes (the Spokes) written in Kotlin. The architecture is a Hub-and-Spoke model. The goal is to synchronously record and align data from various sensors for research.

## Core Technologies

- **PC Controller (Hub):** Python 3.11+, PyQt6, PyBind11 for C++ extensions. Key libraries: `zeroconf`, `PyQtGraph`.
- **Android Sensor Node (Spoke):** Kotlin, Android API Level 33+. Key libraries: CameraX, Nordic BLE Library, UVCCamera for thermal imaging.
- **Communication:** All communication is over TCP/IP using a custom JSON-based protocol. All channels must be secured with TLS 1.2+.

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

- **General:** Follow the Google Style Guides for Python and Kotlin. Code must be clean, readable, and well-documented.
- **Python (Hub):**
    - Use type hints for all function signatures.
    - All GUI components must be subclasses of `QWidget` and managed by the `GUIManager`.
    - All network operations must run in background `QThread` workers to keep the UI responsive.
- **Kotlin (Spoke):**
    - Use Kotlin Coroutines for all asynchronous operations (network, file I/O).
    - Adhere to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
    - All sensor interactions must be encapsulated in their own `SensorRecorder` classes.
- **Testing:**
    - All new functions and methods must be accompanied by unit tests. Use `pytest` for Python and `JUnit`/`Robolectric` for Android.
    - When asked to generate a new feature, also generate the corresponding unit tests that cover primary use cases and edge cases.

##### **2. JetBrains AI Assistant & Junie**

* **Strengths:** Deep IDE integration, context-awareness of the entire project structure, and powerful refactoring capabilities.[16] Junie acts as an autonomous agent that can understand tasks, create an execution plan, and run tests to verify its work.[17]
* **Custom Instructions:** You can create custom prompts and save them to the **Prompt Library** for easy reuse via the `AI Actions` menu.[18, 19]

**Sample Custom Prompt to Save in the JetBrains Prompt Library:**
