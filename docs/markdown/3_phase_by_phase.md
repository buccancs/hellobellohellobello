Of course. Based on the detailed design, here is a phase-by-phase implementation plan that breaks down the development
of the multi-modal data collection platform into a series of manageable stages. Each phase builds upon the last,
culminating in a fully functional and validated system.

### Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

This document outlines a structured, six-phase plan for the implementation of the multi-modal physiological data
acquisition platform. The plan is designed to mitigate risk by building and testing the system incrementally, starting
with core functionalities and progressively adding more complex features.

#### **Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Core Communication Layer**

**Objective:** To establish the foundational project structures and implement the basic network communication that
allows the PC Hub and an Android Spoke to discover and connect with each other.

* **Key Tasks:**
    1. **Project Setup:**
        * Initialize a Git repository for version control.
        * Create the project skeleton for the PC Controller application using Python and PyQt6.[1]
        * Create the project skeleton for the Android Sensor Node application in Android Studio using Kotlin.[1]
    2. **Protocol Definition:**

        * Implement the logic to send start/stop streaming commands and parse incoming data packets.[1]
        * Implement the data conversion from raw 12-bit ADC values to microsiemens (Î¼S) and log the results to a
          timestamped CSV file (FR5).[1, 1]
    4. **Central Control (`RecordingController`):**
        * Develop the main controller to manage the lifecycle of all `SensorRecorder` modules, allowing them to be
          started and stopped in a coordinated manner.[1]

* **Deliverables:**
    * A functional Android application that can, through its own UI, initiate and stop recordings from all three sensor
      modalities simultaneously.
    * Correctly formatted and timestamped data files (MP4, JPGs, CSVs) saved to the device's local storage for each
      recording session.

#### **Phase 3: PC Controller Development and Local Integration**

**Objective:** To build the main user interface of the PC Controller and integrate sensors that connect directly to the
PC, establishing the Hub as a standalone data collection station.

* **Key Tasks:**
    1. **GUI Development (`GUIManager`):**
        * Build the main application window with a tabbed layout using PyQt6.[1]
        * Design and implement the "Dashboard" tab to dynamically display connected devices.[1]
        * Implement live data visualization widgets: a `QLabel` for video and a `PyQtGraph` plot for GSR data (
          FR6).[1, 1]
    2. **High-Integrity Shimmer Integration (`NativeShimmer`):**
        * Develop the C++ backend using PyBind11 to connect to a docked Shimmer sensor via a serial port.[1]
        * Implement the high-performance, low-latency data streaming from the C++ thread to the Python GUI (FR1).[1, 1]
    3. **Local Webcam Integration:**
        * Implement a similar C++ backend module (`NativeWebcam`) to capture frames from a local PC webcam using
          OpenCV.[1]

* **Deliverables:**
    * A functional PC application that can display and record live data from a wired Shimmer sensor and a local webcam.
    * A stable and performant C++ extension module that successfully interfaces with the Python application.

#### **Phase 4: Full System Integration and Synchronization**

**Objective:** To merge the PC Hub and Android Spoke applications into a single, cohesive system capable of
synchronized, multi-device data recording.

* **Key Tasks:**
    1. **Remote Control Implementation:**
        * Connect the GUI controls on the PC to the `NetworkController` to send `start_recording` and `stop_recording`
          commands to all connected Android Spokes (FR2).[1]
    2. **Time Synchronization:**
        * Implement the NTP-like time synchronization protocol to align the clocks of all Android Spokes with the PC
          Hub's master clock (FR3, NFR2).[1, 1]
    3. **Live Preview Streaming:**
        * Implement the functionality for the Android app to send downsampled preview frames to the PC for display in
          the live monitoring dashboard.
    4. **Fault Tolerance:**

          attempt to reconnect and rejoin an ongoing session (FR8, NFR3).[1]

* **Deliverables:**
    * The ability to initiate a synchronized recording across the PC and one or more Android devices with a single
      button click.
    * A set of recorded data files from a multi-device session with timestamps that are verified to be aligned within
      the required tolerance (<5 ms).
    * Demonstrated system resilience to a temporary network interruption.

        * Implement the `FileTransferManager` on the Android Spoke to compress and send session data to the Hub (
          FR10).[1, 1]
        * Implement the `DataAggregator` on the PC Hub to receive and correctly store the incoming data archives (
          FR10).[1]

          them back in a synchronized manner.[1]
    3. **Data Export:**
        * Create a function to process the raw session files (CSVs, videos) and export them into a single,
          analysis-ready HDF5 file using libraries like `pandas` and `h5py`.[1]

* **Deliverables:**
    * A fully automated data transfer process that reliably moves all recorded files from the Android devices to the PC
      at the conclusion of a session.
    * A functional playback tool that allows researchers to review and annotate synchronized multi-modal data.
    * A successfully exported HDF5 file containing all data from a test session.
