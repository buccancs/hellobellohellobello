### Detailed Implementation Plan: Phase 6

**Objective:** To rigorously test the completed system against all requirements, create comprehensive documentation for both end-users and developers, and package the applications for deployment.

-----

#### **Task 6.1: Comprehensive System Testing**

*   **Description:** Conduct a multi-level testing strategy to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the entire platform.
*   **Technology:** `pytest` (Python), `JUnit`/`Robolectric` (Android), manual test scripts.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Unit Testing:**
        *   **PC Controller:** Write `pytest` tests for critical pure-logic components. Focus on the `SessionManager` (correct metadata generation), data parsers for incoming JSON messages, and the data export logic to ensure HDF5 file integrity.
        *   **Android Spoke:** Use `JUnit` for logic tests and `Robolectric` for tests requiring the Android framework without an emulator. Validate the `ShimmerRecorder`'s data conversion algorithms and the `FileTransferManager`'s zipping logic.
    2.  **Integration Testing:**
        *   Verify the full communication loop between the PC and a single Android device. Script a test that sends every defined command and verifies the expected response and state change on both ends.
        *   Test the C++ backend integration by running the PC application and ensuring that data from the `NativeShimmer` and `NativeWebcam` modules is streamed correctly to the Python GUI without memory leaks or crashes.[1]
    3.  **System-Level Validation (Pilot Study):**
        *   Conduct a full, end-to-end pilot data collection session simulating a real research scenario.
        *   **Procedure:** Use the PC Controller, at least two Android Spokes, a wired Shimmer sensor, and a wireless Shimmer sensor. Start a session, record for at least 15 minutes, trigger the "Flash Sync" event multiple times, deliberately disconnect and reconnect one Android device's Wi-Fi, stop the session, and wait for the automated data transfer to complete.
        *   **Verification:**
            *   **Temporal Accuracy (NFR2):** Analyze the recorded videos and sensor logs. Use the "Flash Sync" events to confirm that the timestamps, once adjusted with the calculated clock offsets, are aligned to within the required <5 ms tolerance.[1]
            *   **Data Integrity (NFR4):** Check for any data loss. The number of samples in the GSR CSV files should match the expected count (duration in seconds Ã— 128). Video files should not be corrupted.[1]
            *   **Fault Tolerance (NFR3):** Confirm that the disconnected device continued to record locally and that its data was successfully transferred upon reconnection.[1]
    4.  **Endurance Testing:**
        *   Run the system continuously for an 8-hour period with all sensors active to identify potential memory leaks, performance degradation, or long-term stability issues (NFR7).[1]

#### **Task 6.2: Finalize and Test Calibration Utility (FR9)**

*   **Description:** Complete the implementation of the camera calibration tool and verify its accuracy.
*   **Technology:** OpenCV-Python.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Implement the Calibration Workflow:**
        *   Develop the UI on the PC Controller that guides the researcher through capturing multiple pairs of RGB and thermal images of a checkerboard pattern from different angles.
        *   Implement the backend logic that uses OpenCV's `findChessboardCorners` and `calibrateCamera` functions to compute the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.
    2.  **Save and Apply Calibration:**
        *   Save the resulting calibration matrices to a file within the session directory.
        *   In the "Playback & Annotation" tool, add a feature to apply this calibration to undistort the images and overlay the thermal data onto the RGB video, visually confirming the alignment.

-----

#### **Task 6.3: Create Comprehensive Documentation (NFR6, NFR8)**

*   **Description:** Produce clear and thorough documentation for both end-users (researchers) and future developers.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **User Manual:**
        *   Write a step-by-step guide covering:
            *   Installation of the PC application and Android APK.
            *   Hardware setup (connecting cameras and sensors).
            *   A complete walkthrough of a data collection session.
            *   Instructions for using the calibration and playback tools.
            *   A troubleshooting section for common issues (e.g., network problems, sensor not connecting).
    2.  **Developer Documentation:**
        *   Ensure all code is well-commented, particularly the complex modules (network protocol, C++ backend, data parsers).
        *   Create a `README.md` file in the root of the repository that explains the project's architecture, how to build the code from source, and how to run the tests.
        *   Finalize the `PROTOCOL.md` document with a complete specification of all JSON commands and message formats.

-----

#### **Task 6.4: Application Packaging and Deployment**

*   **Description:** Package the PC and Android applications into distributable formats for easy installation.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **PC Controller:**
        *   Use `PyInstaller` or a similar tool to bundle the Python application, all its dependencies, and the compiled C++ backend into a single standalone executable for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    2.  **Android Sensor Node:**
        *   Generate a signed, release-ready APK file from the Android Studio project.
    3.  **Final Release:**
        *   Create a final release on the Git repository.
        *   Upload the packaged PC executables and the Android APK.
        *   Include the User Manual as a PDF and write clear release notes summarizing the features and any known issues.

#### **Phase 6 Deliverables and Verification**

*   **Software:**
    *   A final, stable, and packaged version of the PC Controller application for all major operating systems.
    *   A final, signed APK of the Android Sensor Node application.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   A complete User Manual in PDF format.
    *   Comprehensive developer documentation within the source code repository.
*   **Verification Criteria:**
    *   **Test Report:** A summary document showing that all unit, integration, and system-level tests have passed and that all functional and non-functional requirements have been met.
    *   **Successful Deployment:** The packaged applications can be successfully installed and run on a clean machine (one that was not used for development) without requiring manual dependency installation.
    *   **Pilot Data Validation:** The data collected during the pilot study is complete, synchronized, and can be successfully loaded and analyzed using the provided export tools.
