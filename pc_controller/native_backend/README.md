Native Backend (C++ via PyBind11) - Placeholder

Phase 1 placeholder for the high-performance native backend.

Planned components (for later phases):
- NativeShimmer: C++ Shimmer integration using the official Shimmer C-API.
- NativeWebcam: C++ OpenCV-based webcam capture exposing zero-copy frames to Python.

Build system and bindings will be added in Phase 3+ per design docs.
